# AB_Testing
A/B testing is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better. It is used to determine which variation performs better for a given conversion goal.

## Business Problem
Facebook recently introduced a new type of bid, average bidding, as an alternative to the current type of bidding called maximum bidding. One of our customers has decided to test this new feature and wants to do an A/B test to see if averagebidding converts more than maximumbidding.

## Dataset Story
In this dataset, which includes our customer's website information, there is information such as the number of advertisements that users see and click, as well as earnings information from here. There are two separate data sets, the control and test groups.

## Columns
* Impression– Ad views
* Click – Indicates the number of clicks on the displayed ad.
* Purchase – Indicates the number of products purchased after the ads clicked.
* Earning – Earnings after purchased products
